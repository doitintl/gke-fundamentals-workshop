# @warn: please be aware of the limits of pod-resources in GKE/k8s regarding declarative updates!
#        pod updates may not change fields other than `spec.containers[*].image`,

# @info: Here we create a simple pod resource that describes a nginx-based static web application
#        and provisions it within the cluster. You can access this pod from your local environment
#        by kubectl's port-forwarding command and access the web-application on localhost:8080 ...
#
#        $ kubectl port-forward pod/static-web-app-advanced 8080:80 -n doit-lab-02

  # An initContainer in Kubernetes is a special type of container that runs to completion before the main app’s container
  # and the pod will repeatedly restart until all of them succeed. It’s sometimes necessary to prepare the primary container
  # which will be running our application or the main logic, and it's accomplished through initContainers.

  # These are our two primary container definitions within the pod. Both containers share the same namespaces, cgroups
  # and potentially other facets of isolation - the same things that isolate a Docker container. Within a Pod's context,
  # the individual applications may have further sub-isolations applied. In terms of Docker concepts, a Pod is similar
  # to a group of Docker containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes.
