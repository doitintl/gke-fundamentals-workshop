  # This is the default method for many Kubernetes installations in the cloud, and it works great.
  # It supports multiple protocols and multiple ports per service. But by default it uses an IP for
  # every service, and that IP is configured to have its own load balancer configured in the cloud.
  # These add costs and overhead that is overkill for essentially every cluster with multiple svc,
  # which is almost every cluster these days.
