## Deployment

1. Run deployment

```bash
kubectl apply -f .
```

2. Check current ingress state (external IP)

_this step can take up to 3 Minutes_

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n doit-lab-15 --watch
```

## Cluster Application Check / Playground

1. You can check the state of Pods at any time with the following kubectl command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n doit-lab-15
```

2. You can check your ingress target service with the following kubectl command:

```bash
kubectl get service -n doit-lab-15
```

3. You can get some more detailed information about your ingress resource by the following kubectl command:

```bash
kubectl describe ingress neg-demo-ing -n doit-lab-15
```

4. As soon as your ingress resource and the corresponding loadBalancer is provisioned (3-4 minutes):

4.1 You can check the benchmark of your web-application using apache-bench command as shown below:

```bash
ab -n 20 http://<external-ip-of-your-ingress-load-balancer>/
```

4.2 You can simulate some traffic to your ingress facing loadBalancer by the following ab-command:

```bash
ab -n 500 -c 25 http://<external-ip-of-your-ingress-load-balancer>/
```

4.3 Or just visit the application by hitting your load-balancers external-IP:

```bash
  -> http://<external-ip-of-your-ingress-load-balancer>/
```

5. Verify ingress functionality

```bash
# scale up the deployment to two replicas
kubectl scale deployment neg-demo-app -n doit-lab-15 --replicas 2
# wait a minute or two for it to complete, and verify that you have two replicas running:
kubectl get deployment neg-demo-app -n doit-lab-15
# get your ingress' public IP:
kubectl describe ingress neg-demo-ing -n doit-lab-15
```

Then verify funtionality and count distinct responses by running:

```bash
# un this command to send 100 requests to your load balancer and count distinct responses:
INGRESS_IP="$(kubectl get ingress -n doit-lab-15 neg-demo-ing -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')"
for i in $(seq 1 100); do \
  curl --connect-timeout 1 -s $INGRESS_IP && echo; \
done  | sort | uniq -c
```

The result should look similar to this:

```bash
44 neg-demo-app-7f7dfd7bc6-dcn95
56 neg-demo-app-7f7dfd7bc6-jrmzf
```

## Application Clean-Up

```bash
kubectl delete -f .
```
