# @warn: please be aware of the limits of pod-resources in GKE/k8s regarding declarative updates!
#        pod updates may not change fields other than `spec.containers[*].image`,

# @info: Here we create a simple pod resource that describes a nginx-based static web application
#        and provisions it within the cluster. You can access this pod from your local environment
#        by kubectl's port-forwarding command and access the web-application on localhost:8080 ...
#
#        $ kubectl port-forward pod/static-web-app 8080:80 -n doit-lab-01

  # This is our primary container, which carries a simple static web application and opens a dedicated
  # container port (http-80). We can describe some content elements of the application by means of env-
  # variables, e.g. the variable 'C_MESSAGE' overwrites the default welcome text of the application.
